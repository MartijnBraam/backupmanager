Welcome to Backup Manager's documentation!
==========================================

Backup Manager is a wrapper around various backup tools. It has a generic configuration for what to backup and a mostly
generic configuration for the backup destination. This makes it easy to switch backup software or manage a bunch of
computers with multiple backup tools.
